##  dash_minimalistic and MVC

These simple examples explore how to organize the code in order to facilitate its development, modularity and of course maintainability. The idea is to comply with aa so-called MVC architecture.

The first example, a one-pager application precisely called `app_one_page.py`, already clearly separates data from views and controls within the file. The next step is to go to a folder separated code organization, together with a head file `app_MVC.py` from which the app is launched.

Example sin the `src/app_MVC` folder look at how the MVC principles can be used to organize code of a `dash` app.
